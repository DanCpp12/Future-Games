all the cars behave diffrently (they have difrent stats and torque curves).
the tracks are 2 laps.
be carful not to flip your car (if you do restart the race).

I had it so it would automaticly switch to next track but if you started on the last track on the list when you finish it switched to the main menu. so i made it so it dosen't switch to next trak but main menu.
the stearing I use is Ackermann steering geometry witch I saw from a tutorial from the playlist see below.
I looked up what it is on wikipedia and implimented it the variables are wb = "distans betwen front and back wheels" tw = "distans betwen left and right wheels"


thigns I wanted to have but did not have the time for is split time and memory of the best time/leader board, boost meter and when you drift it would refill the boost meter.



things I did wrong:
	I made extra prefabs of the track pices that I did not nead to but I had already used them so instead of stop using them i continued because of you dont want more than one standard.
	instead of writing Manager I wrote Maneger witch is a speling error and i did not realise it untill someone pointed it out. changing it was not a priorety (and it is more fun if I dont change it).
	should have commentated more.



this was my first time using Unity so I am not familar with the Unity commands so i loked at tutorials for the cars.
the first thing I looked at unitys documentation of the wheel coliders to start.
all the tutorials I used exists in this youtube playlist (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhWBaV_gmpGXxscZr8PIcreyYkw8VlnKn) I did not use every tutorial in that playlist.
the good thing about that playlist is that it is one project and made by one person so you can see how the difrent parts work together.
